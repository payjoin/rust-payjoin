## About

### `payjoin`

The Payjoin Dev Kit `payjoin` library implements both [BIP 78 Payjoin V1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki) and [BIP 77 Payjoin V2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0077.md).

### Feature Flags

The `payjoin` crate supports the following features:
- `v1`: Enables BIP 78 Payjoin V1 support.
- `v2`: Enables BIP 77 Payjoin V2 support (enabled by default).
- `directory`: Enables Payjoin Directory support.

**Note:**
The crate will now build with no features enabled (e.g., `cargo build --no-default-features`), but in this configuration, no functionality is available. This is intended to support comprehensive CI and linting. To use the library, enable at least one of the features above.

### `payjoin-cli`

The [`payjoin-cli`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/master/payjoin-cli) crate performs no-frills Payjoin as a reference implementation using Bitcoin Core wallet.

### `payjoin-directory`

The [`payjoin-directory`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/master/payjoin-directory) crate implements the Payjoin Directory store-and-forward server required for Payjoin V2's asynchronous operation.

### `payjoin-test-utils`

The [`payjoin-test-utils`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/master/payjoin-test-utils) crate provides commonly used testing fixtures such as a local OHTTP relay and payjoin directory, bitcoind node and wallets, and official test vectors.

### `payjoin-ffi`

The [`payjoin-ffi`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/master/payjoin-ffi) crate provides language bindings that expose the Rust-based Payjoin implementation to various programming languages.

### Disclaimer ⚠️ WIP

**Use at your own risk. This crate has not yet been reviewed by independent Rust and Bitcoin security professionals.**

While I don't think there is a _huge_ risk running it, be careful relying on its security for now!

Seeking review of the code that verifies there is no overpayment. Contributions are welcome!
