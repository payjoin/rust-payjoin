# `ubrn build` generates a Rust wasm crate in rust_modules/wasm, with `wasm-bindgen` annotated functions.
# That crate is used to generate TS bindings which call into the `wasm-bindgen` functions.
# Because that generated crate doesn't belong to the `payjoin` workspace, we need to patch the generated Cargo.toml accordingly for local development.
# The patch is applied via the ubrn.config.yaml `manifestPatchFile` option.
# The paths below are relative to payjoin-ffi/javascript/rust_modules/wasm/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# Pin wasm-bindgen to match the CLI version in .github/workflows/javascript.yml.
# The generated template uses "*", which resolves to latest. A mismatch between
# the library and CLI versions causes "unreachable" panics at runtime.
