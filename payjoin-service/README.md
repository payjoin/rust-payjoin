# payjoin-service

Unified Payjoin Directory and OHTTP Relay service. Combines [payjoin-directory](../payjoin-directory/README.md) and [ohttp-relay](../ohttp-relay/README.md) into a single binary.

Note that this binary is under active development and thus the CLI and configuration file may be unstable.
