//! Receive BIP 78 Payjoin v1
//!
//! This module contains types and methods used to receive payjoin via BIP78.
//! Usage is pretty simple:
//!
//! 1. Generate a pj_uri [BIP 21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki)
//!    using [`build_v1_pj_uri`]
//! 2. Listen for a sender's request on the `pj` endpoint
//! 3. Parse the request using
//!    [`UncheckedOriginalPayload::from_request()`]
//! 4. Validate the proposal using the `check` methods to guide you.
//! 5. Assuming the proposal is valid, augment it into a payjoin with the available
//!    `try_preserving_privacy` and `contribute` methods
//! 6. Extract the payjoin PSBT and sign it
//! 7. Respond to the sender's http request with the signed PSBT as payload.
//!
//! The `receive` feature provides all of the check methods, PSBT data manipulation, coin
//! selection, and transport structures to receive payjoin and handle errors in a privacy
//! preserving way.
//!
//! Receiving payjoin entails listening to a secure http endpoint for inbound requests.  The
//! endpoint is displayed in the `pj` parameter of a [bip
//! 21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) request URI.
//!
//! [reference implementation](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/master/payjoin-cli)
//!
//! OHTTP Privacy Warning
//! Encapsulated requests whether GET or POSTâ€”**must not be retried or reused**.
//! Retransmitting the same ciphertext (including via automatic retries) breaks the unlinkability and privacy guarantees of OHTTP,
//! as it allows the relay to correlate requests by comparing ciphertexts.
//! Note: Even fresh requests may be linkable via metadata (e.g. client IP, request timing),
//! but request reuse makes correlation trivial for the relay.
