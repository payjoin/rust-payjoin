#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]

//! # Payjoin implementation in Rust
//!
//! Supercharge payment batching to save you fees and preserve your privacy.
//!
//! This library implements both [BIP 78 Payjoin V1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki) and [BIP 77 Payjoin V2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0077.md).
//!
//! Only the latest BIP 77 Payjoin V2 is enabled by default. To use BIP 78 Payjoin V1, enable the `v1` feature.
//!
//! The library is perfectly IO-agnostic — in fact, it does no IO by default without the `io` feature.
//!
//! Types relevant to a Payjoin Directory as defined in BIP 77 are available in the [`directory`] module enabled by
//!  the `directory` feature.
//!
//! ## Disclaimer ⚠️ WIP
//!
//! **Use at your own risk. This crate has not yet been reviewed by independent Rust and Bitcoin security professionals.**
